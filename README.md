#Foreign-Exchange-Analysis
This was an independent project that I did to demonstrate skills in pandas, numpy, sci-kit learn and other data analysis libraries.

The goal of the project was to build a model that could predict USD/GBP (US Dollar to Great British Pound) and USD/RMB (US Dollar to Chinese Yuan)

I downloaded data from two sources; The Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) and Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)

Detailed descriptions of the data can be found in the csv file.
